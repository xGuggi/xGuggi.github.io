            <li><strong>Transaction History:</strong> The application provides users with the ability to review their transaction history, including options to view history for specific accounts or for all accounts.</li>
            <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> Designed with React.js, the interface is dynamic and responsive, featuring modal components for additional transaction details and history. Form validation and error handling enhance the user experience.</li>
